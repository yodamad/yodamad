## Hi everyone 👋 : I'm Matthieu (aka yodamad)

I'm a tech advocate and DevOps Platform Leader [Sopra Steria](https://soprasteria.com) company.

I'm working in IT for more than 15 years, and love that 😅

For some years, I'm also :
- ✍️ writing some articles to discover tools, langages in my [blog](https://yodamad.hashnode.dev/)
  - 🗞️ You can subscribe to the [newsletter](https://yodamad.hashnode.dev/newsletter) to receive to future ones
- 🌋 organizing the tech conference [Volcamp](https://volcamp.io) in my home region
- 🎤 speaking in conferences since 2022 (DevoXX France, Breizhcamp, Snowcamp, DevFest Lille...)
- 🦊 participating to GitLab Hero program
- 🤖 helping a cool company called [R2DevOps](https://r2devops.io/) that provide a tool to secure your company software supply chain

When I'm not coding or talking about tech, I love building Lego 🧱 and playing basketball with my kid.
